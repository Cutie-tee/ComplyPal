What approach is used to determine the regulatory burden placed on AI systems?,A risk-based approach is used.,"The AI Act uses a risk-based approach to determine the regulatory burden placed on AI systems. This approach classifies AI systems into three risk levels: unacceptable risk, high risk, and low risk. The regulatory burden placed on AI systems increases with the level of risk.

For example, AI systems that are considered to be unacceptable risk are prohibited from being placed on the market. AI systems that are considered to be high risk must comply with a number of requirements, including transparency obligations, record-keeping obligations, and risk management obligations. AI systems that are considered to be low risk are subject to fewer requirements.

The AI Act also establishes a subset of general-purpose AI with systemic risk, which refers to a general-purpose AI model that ""has high impact capabilities evaluated on the basis of ... the cumulative amount of computation used for its training measured in floating point operations is greater than 1025."" Providers of GPAI models that involve systemic risk are subject to a specific set of regulatory obligations under the AI Act.

This risk-based approach is designed to ensure that the regulatory burden placed on AI systems is proportionate to the risks that they pose.

4. **Bias Monitoring and Correction:** To the extent strictly necessary for bias monitoring, detection, and correction in relation to the high-risk AI systems, the providers of such systems may process special categories of personal data. (Source: eu_ai_act.pdf, Section 5)","When working with machine learning models, it's important to properly structure and manage your datasets into training, validation, and testing sets to ensure your model generalizes well to unseen data. Here are the requirements and best practices for each of these datasets:

### 1. **Training Dataset**
- **Purpose**: Used to train the model. The model learns patterns and relationships in the data.
- **Size**: Typically, the majority (usually around 60-80%) of the total dataset.
- **Diversity**: Should represent the full range of the data, including all classes and variations, to ensure the model learns from a comprehensive sample.
- **Quality**: Data should be clean and pre-processed to remove noise or outliers that could negatively impact learning.

### 2. **Validation Dataset**
- **Purpose**: Used to tune model parameters and make decisions about the model's architecture, ensuring it doesn't overfit the training data.
- **Size**: Generally makes up about 10-20% of the total dataset.
- **Independence**: Should not overlap with the training dataset to provide an unbiased estimate of model performance during training.
- **Availability**: Data in this set should also be varied and representative to provide reliable feedback on model performance.
- **Frequency of Use**: Validation sets can be used for multiple experiments; however, care should be taken to avoid ""leakage,"" whereby the model inadvertently learns from the validation set.

### 3. **Testing Dataset**
- **Purpose**: Used to evaluate the final model performance after training and validation are completed. This dataset estimates how the model will perform on unseen data.
- **Size**: Typically represents around 10-20% of the total dataset, similar to validation sets.
- **Independence**: Must be completely separate from both the training and validation datasets; there should be no overlap in data points.
- **Final Evaluation**: Should be used once the model is finalized, and no further tuning is conducted; serves as a check on generalization.

### Best Practices
- **Random Splitting**: When organizing datasets, use random sampling to ensure that all three datasets are representative of the overall data distribution.
- **Stratification**: If the dataset is imbalanced (e.g., highly skewed classes), consider stratifying the splits to maintain class proportions across training, validation, and testing datasets.
- **Size Considerations**: Ensure that the datasets are large enough to yield statistically reliable results, especially for the test set. 
- **Cross-Validation**: In cases where data is limited, k-fold cross-validation may be used to augment the training process while still reserving a portion for final testing.

By adhering to these requirements and best practices, you can ensure a more reliable and effective machine learning model.",8,9,7,8.200000000000001,4,5,6,4.800000000000001

What is automation bias?,The tendency to automatically rely or over-rely on the output produced by a high-risk AI system.,"Automation bias is a tendency to over-rely on the output of an automated system, even when it is not appropriate to do so (Source: eu_ai_act.pdf). This can lead to errors and accidents, as the system may not be able to take into account all of the relevant factors in a given situation.

For example, a self-driving car may not be able to react to an unexpected obstacle in the road, or a medical diagnosis system may not be able to take into account all of the patient's symptoms.

It is important to be aware of automation bias and to take steps to mitigate its effects. This can include:

* **Understanding the limitations of the automated system.** What are its strengths and weaknesses?
* **Monitoring the system's output.** Are there any anomalies or dysfunctions that need to be addressed?
* **Using the system as a tool, not a replacement for human judgment.** The system should be used to support decision-making, not to make decisions on its own.","Automation bias refers to the tendency of individuals to rely on automated systems or technologies to make decisions, often leading to a reduction in critical thinking and oversight. This phenomenon occurs when users exhibit increased trust in the outcomes produced by automated systems—such as algorithms, artificial intelligence, or machine learning tools—regardless of the accuracy or appropriateness of those outcomes.

Factors contributing to automation bias include:

1. **Over-reliance**: Users may develop an over-reliance on technology, assuming that automated tools are infallible or superior to human judgment.
2. **Reduced scrutiny**: When relying on automated systems, individuals might not double-check or critically evaluate the information provided, leading to the acceptance of errors or misleading outcomes.
3. **Confirmation bias**: Users might only seek or accept results that align with their existing beliefs or expectations, further entrenching the reliance on automated tools.
4. **Information overload**: The complexity and volume of data processed by automation can overwhelm users, making them more likely to defer to the system's output without thorough examination.

Automation bias can be particularly concerning in high-stakes environments, such as healthcare, aviation, finance, and cybersecurity, where the consequences of incorrect decisions can be much more severe. To mitigate automation bias, organizations can emphasize training, encourage critical thinking, and establish procedures for human oversight of automated decision-making processes.",7,8,8,7.6,8,7,8,7.6

3. **Transparency**: Provide transparency regarding the use of the system. This includes informing the public about the deployment of such technologies, the types of data collected, and how it will be used.

4. **Data Minimization**: Use only the data necessary for the intended purpose. Avoid collecting excessive biometric information that is not required for the specific law enforcement objective.

5. **Oversight and Accountability**: Establish clear oversight mechanisms to monitor the use of RBIS. This may involve regular audits, reports to oversight bodies, and mechanisms for accountability.

6. **Impact Assessments**: Conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) prior to implementation to evaluate the potential risks to privacy and civil liberties, and to identify measures to mitigate those risks.

7. **Consent and Rights of Individuals**: Consider the implications of biometric data collection on individual rights, including obtaining consent where necessary and informing individuals of their rights regarding their data.

8. **Proportionality and Necessity**: Ensure that the use of RBIS is proportionate to the risks and benefits. Assess whether less intrusive means could achieve the same objectives.

9. **Security Measures**: Implement strong security measures to protect biometric data against unauthorized access, breaches, and misuse. This includes encryption and secure storage solutions.

10. **Retention and Deletion Policies**: Develop and enforce strict data retention policies, specifying how long biometric data will be stored and the processes for secure deletion when it is no longer needed.

11. **Training**: Provide training for law enforcement personnel on the ethical use of biometric technologies and the importance of respecting privacy rights.

12. **Public Engagement**: Engage with community stakeholders, including civil society organizations, to discuss the implementation and implications of the technology, gathering public input and addressing concerns.

Meeting these requirements helps to ensure that the use of real-time remote biometric identification systems aligns with legal standards and respects the rights and freedoms of individuals in society.",7,6,7,6.600000000000001,4,6,7,5.4
