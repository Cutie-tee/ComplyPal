What actions do not constitute valid consent?,"Silence, pre-ticked boxes, or inactivity","Silence, pre-ticked boxes, or inactivity","Valid consent is a crucial concept in various contexts, including medical procedures, sexual activity, and legal agreements. For consent to be valid, it must be freely given, informed, and reversible. There are several actions, situations, or conditions that do not constitute valid consent, including:

1. **Coercion or Duress**: Consent obtained through threats, intimidation, or pressure does not constitute valid consent. If an individual feels forced or manipulated into agreeing to something, their consent is not genuine.

2. **Manipulation or Deception**: If someone misleads another person about the nature of an act or the consequences of giving consent, the consent is not valid. This includes lying about what will happen or failing to disclose critical information.

3. **Incapacity**: Individuals who are unable to give consent due to mental impairment, intoxication, unconsciousness, or any form of incapacitation cannot provide valid consent. This includes minors or individuals under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

4. **Lack of Information**: Consent must be informed. If a person is not provided with all necessary information to make a sound decision, their consent may be invalid. This could involve not disclosing risks, benefits, or alternative options.

5. **Withdrawal of Consent**: Valid consent can be revoked at any time. If someone withdraws their consent but the act continues, then consent is no longer valid. Ignoring a person's desire to end an agreement or interaction is a violation of their rights.

6. **Conditional Consent**: Sometimes, consent may be given under certain conditions. If those conditions are not met or respected and the actions proceed anyway, the original consent may no longer be valid.

7. **Implied Consent Violations**: While implied consent can exist based on actions and circumstances, it should not be assumed in situations where explicit consent is required. For example, just because two people have engaged in intimate relations in the past does not mean consent is implied for future encounters.

8. **Power Imbalance**: Consent obtained in situations where there is an inherent power imbalance, such as a teacher-student, employer-employee, or doctor-patient relationship, can be problematic. Even if someone seems to agree, they may feel compelled due to their subordinate position.

Understanding these factors is crucial to ensuring that all parties respect each other's rights and autonomy in any agreement or interaction. Valid consent is not just a matter of saying “yes”; it involves clarity, respect, and the freedom to choose without undue influence.",10,2

They shall have the appropriate statistical properties, including, where applicable, as regards the persons or groups of persons on which the high-risk AI system is intended to be used.","Training, validation, and testing data sets shall be relevant, representative, free of errors and complete. They shall have the appropriate statistical properties, including, where applicable, as regards the persons or groups of persons on which the high-risk AI system is intended to be used. These characteristics of the data sets may be met at the level of individual data sets or a combination thereof.

Training, validation and testing data sets shall take into account, to the extent required by the intended purpose, the characteristics or elements that are particular to the specific geographical, behavioural or functional setting within which the high-risk AI system is intended to be used.","Training, validation, and testing datasets are crucial components of machine learning and data science workflows. Each of these datasets serves a distinct purpose, and it is essential to follow specific requirements to ensure the effectiveness and reliability of a predictive model. Here are the detailed requirements for each type of dataset:

### Training Dataset

1. **Size**: 
   - The training data should be sufficiently large to capture the underlying patterns of the problem. The more complex the model, the larger the training set generally needs to be.

2. **Representativeness**: 
   - The dataset should represent the overall population or problem domain. It should include a variety of examples that capture the diversity of the input space.

3. **Balanced Classes**: 
   - If the task involves classification, the classes should ideally be balanced to prevent bias. In cases of imbalanced classes, techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or synthetic data generation may be necessary.

4. **Feature Quality**: 
   - The features in the training dataset should be relevant and meaningful for the target variable. They should include a mixture of numerical and categorical data as required by the model.

5. **No Data Leakage**: 
   - The training data must not contain any information from the validation or test sets, as this can lead to overfitting and an inaccurate assessment of model performance.

### Validation Dataset

1. **Size**: 
   - The validation set should typically be a smaller fraction of the total dataset (often 10-20%). It should be large enough to provide a reliable estimate of model performance but not so large as to take away from the training dataset.

2. **Independence**: 
   - The validation dataset must be drawn from the same distribution as the training dataset but should remain independent. This means that the validation set should not overlap with the training set.

3. **Help in Hyperparameter Tuning**: 
   - The validation set is used to tune hyperparameters of the model. It should provide a realistic scenario to assess how changes to hyperparameters affect model performance.

4. **Performance Metrics**: 
   - It’s important to use appropriate metrics that reflect the problem domain when evaluating the model on the validation set (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

### Testing Dataset

1. **Size**: 
   - Similar to the validation set, the test set should be large enough to provide a robust evaluation of the model's generalization capabilities, typically around 10-20% of the total dataset.

2. **Final Evaluation**: 
   - The test dataset is used for the final evaluation of the model after training and validation. It is crucial that this data has not been used in any way during the training or hyperparameter tuning phases.

3. **Independence**: 
   - Like the validation dataset, the test set should be independent of both the training and validation sets. It should provide an unbiased assessment of the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.

4. **Real-World Representation**: 
   - It is beneficial if the test set reflects the real-world scenario where the model will eventually be employed. This means it should include cases that are representative of actual operational conditions.

### General Best Practices

- **Random Splitting**: 
  - When splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets, randomization helps ensure that the splits are representative of the overall data distribution.

- **Stratified Sampling**: 
  - For classification tasks, especially with imbalanced datasets, stratified sampling can ensure that all classes are appropriately represented in each of the datasets.

- **Cross-Validation**: 
  - Instead of a single validation set, k-fold cross-validation can be employed for more robust model validation. This method allows for multiple training and validation sets, providing a better estimation of model performance.

- **Data Preprocessing**: 
  - All datasets should undergo the same preprocessing steps to ensure consistency. This includes normalization, encoding categorical variables, handling missing values, and feature selection.

In summary, careful consideration of the requirements for training, validation, and testing datasets is essential for building reliable machine learning models that generalize well to new, unseen data.",8,7

What is automation bias?,The tendency to automatically rely or over-rely on the output produced by a high-risk AI system.,"The possible tendency of automatically relying or over-relying on the output produced by a high-risk AI system, in particular for high-risk AI systems used to provide information or recommendations for decisions to be taken by natural persons.","Automation bias is a cognitive phenomenon where individuals place an undue level of trust in automated systems or technologies, often leading to errors in judgment or decision-making. This bias can occur in various contexts, such as healthcare, aviation, finance, and many other fields where automated systems are used to assist or guide human operators.

### Characteristics of Automation Bias:

1. **Overreliance on Automation**: Individuals may overly depend on automated recommendations or outputs, assuming they are infallible, which can lead to neglecting their own expertise or instinct.

2. **Neglect of Manual Checks**: When an automated system indicates a specific course of action, users might skip manual verification or consideration of alternative information, even when their own knowledge or available data suggests a different approach.

3. **Reduced Situational Awareness**: Automation can reduce an operator's level of engagement or attention to the overall situation. This can lead to a lack of critical thinking about the automation’s recommendations or outputs.

4. **Confirmation Bias**: Users may tend to favor information that confirms the automated system's outputs or recommendations while disregarding contradictory data that they may have otherwise considered.

### Factors Contributing to Automation Bias:

- **Complexity of Information**: In fields with complex data, users might trust automation to process and analyze information rather than conducting a detailed analysis themselves.
  
- **User Experience**: If users frequently interact with an automated system that has previously provided accurate results, they may develop a sense of trust that extends to future interactions.

- **Training and Familiarity**: Lack of training on the limitations and appropriate use of automated systems can increase reliance on them.

- **System Design**: Poorly designed systems that do not provide clear explanations for their outputs or recommendations can lead to misunderstanding and misplaced trust.

### Potential Consequences:

1. **Errors in Critical Fields**: In areas like healthcare (e.g., relying on algorithms for diagnosis without reviewing patient history) or aviation (e.g., overreliance on autopilot systems), automation bias can lead to significant safety risks.

2. **Reduced Accountability**: When decisions are made based on automated recommendations, it may blur the lines of responsibility and accountability if something goes wrong.

3. **Stagnation of Skills**: Overreliance on automated systems may inhibit the development and maintenance of individual skills and critical thinking capabilities.

### Mitigating Automation Bias:

There are several strategies to reduce the impact of automation bias:

- **Enhancing Training**: Providing comprehensive training about the limitations and expected use of automated systems helps users make informed decisions.

- **Designing Better Systems**: Creating more transparent systems where the underlying logic and rationale for automated decisions are clearly communicated can empower users.

- **Encouraging a Team-based Approach**: Involving multiple stakeholders in decision-making processes can counteract individual biases and increase scrutiny of automated recommendations.

- **Periodic System Checks**: Regular audits of automated systems and their recommendations may encourage users to stay engaged and critical of the automation.

By being aware of automation bias and actively working to mitigate its effects, organizations and individuals can enhance decision-making processes and improve overall outcomes in their respective fields.",9,8
