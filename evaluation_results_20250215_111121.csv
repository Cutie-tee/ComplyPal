What approach is used to determine the regulatory burden placed on AI systems?,A risk-based approach is used.,"The AI Act uses a risk-based approach to determine the regulatory burden placed on AI systems. This approach classifies AI systems into different levels of risk, with higher-risk systems subject to more stringent regulatory requirements.

The AI Act defines three levels of risk:

* **Unacceptable risk:** AI systems that pose a serious risk to the health, safety, or fundamental rights of individuals. These systems are prohibited from being placed on the market.
* **High risk:** AI systems that pose a significant risk to the health, safety, or fundamental rights of individuals. These systems are subject to strict regulatory requirements, including transparency obligations and conformity assessments.
* **Low risk:** AI systems that do not pose a significant risk to the health, safety, or fundamental rights of individuals. These systems are subject to fewer regulatory requirements.

The AI Act also establishes a subset of general-purpose AI (GPAI) models with systemic risk. These models are subject to specific regulatory obligations, depending on whether they involve systemic risk or not.

The risk level of an AI system is determined by a number of factors, including the intended use of the system, the type of data that the system processes, and the potential impact of the system on individuals.

The AI Act's risk-based approach is designed to ensure that AI systems are developed and used in a responsible manner. By classifying AI systems into different levels of risk, the AI Act provides a clear framework for regulators and businesses to understand the regulatory requirements that apply to AI systems.

When is disclosure of AI interaction required?,When persons interact with an AI system or their emotions or characteristics are recognised through automated means,"**When is disclosure of AI interaction required?**

According to **Article 52(1) of the EU AI Act**, providers must ensure that AI systems intended to interact with natural persons are designed and developed in such a way that natural persons are informed that they are interacting with an AI system, unless this is obvious from the circumstances and the context of use.

This obligation does not apply to AI systems authorized by law to detect, prevent, investigate, and prosecute criminal offenses, unless those systems are available for the public to report a criminal offense.

Additionally, **Article 52(2) of the EU AI Act** requires users of an emotion recognition system or a biometric categorization system to inform of the operation of the system the natural persons exposed thereto. This obligation does not apply to AI systems used for biometric categorization, which are permitted by law to detect, prevent, and investigate criminal offenses.","Disclosure of AI interaction is generally required in several contexts, particularly when transparency is necessary to ensure ethical use and trust in AI systems. While exact requirements can vary based on jurisdiction, industry, and specific use cases, there are some common scenarios where disclosure is typically required or recommended:

1. **Consumer Protection Laws**: Many jurisdictions have laws that protect consumers from deceptive practices. If an AI system is used in a way that could mislead consumers about its nature (e.g., AI-generated content or interactions), disclosure may be required to ensure that consumers are informed they are interacting with or receiving content from an AI.

2. **Automated Decision-Making**: In contexts where AI is used for significant decision-making processes (e.g., credit scoring, hiring, etc.), regulations such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) may require organizations to disclose the use of automated decision-making systems, especially if these decisions can affect individuals’ rights.

3. **AI in Employment**: If AI is used in recruitment or employee evaluation, there may be requirements to disclose this to applicants or employees, particularly if decisions about hiring or promotions are influenced by AI-driven assessments.

4. **Advertising and Marketing**: When AI is used to generate content or personalize marketing strategies, businesses may be obligated to disclose the use of AI technologies, especially if the content is not clearly identifiable as being produced by AI.

5. **Voice Assistants and Chatbots**: If users are interacting with AI systems such as virtual assistants or chatbots, some jurisdictions encourage or require disclosure that they are interacting with an AI rather than a human to avoid confusion and build trust.

6. **Ethical Guidelines and Best Practices**: Various organizations and industry groups may advocate for best practices around transparency, prompting businesses to disclose AI usage in a way that enhances ethical considerations and accountability.

In practice, keeping abreast of local laws, industry regulations, and ethical guidelines is essential for determining when disclosure is required. Organizations are encouraged to establish clear policies regarding AI interactions to ensure compliance and maintain consumer trust.",8,7,8,7.6,8,8,9,8.200000000000001

* **Special Categories of Personal Data:** Processing of special categories of personal data (e.g., race, religion, health data) may be allowed for bias monitoring, detection, and correction purposes. [Source: eu_ai_act.pdf, Section 5]","The requirements for training, validation, and testing datasets can vary based on the specific context (e.g., machine learning models, statistical analyses, etc.), but generally, the following guidelines apply:

### 1. **Training Dataset**
- **Size**: Should be large enough to provide a representative sample of the underlying population. A rule of thumb is to have a larger dataset for more complex models.
- **Diversity**: The data should encompass a variety of scenarios to help the model generalize well. Ensure it includes different classes, conditions, and variations pertinent to the problem.
- **Quality**: Data should be cleaned and pre-processed to remove noise, handle missing values, and ensure accurate labels.
- **Relevance**: Must contain features that are relevant to the prediction task. Irrelevant features can lead to overfitting.

### 2. **Validation Dataset**
- **Size**: Typically smaller than the training dataset, but large enough to provide reliable performance estimates. It usually comprises 10-20% of the total dataset.
- **Independence**: Should be drawn from the same distribution as the training data but should not overlap with it. This helps evaluate the model’s performance on unseen data.
- **Balanced Representation**: Similar to the training set, it should maintain the same distribution of classes to ensure that model tuning and selection are accurate.
- **Usage**: Employ this data for hyperparameter tuning and model selection to avoid overfitting.

### 3. **Testing Dataset**
- **Size**: It should be large enough to ensure that the performance metrics derived from it are statistically significant. Generally, it should also comprise around 10-20% of the original dataset.
- **Independence**: Completely independent from both the training and validation sets; it should represent a real-world scenario to assess how well the model performs outside its training environment.
- **Final Evaluation**: This dataset should only be used for the final evaluation of the model after the training and tuning processes are complete, providing a true measure of the model’s performance.

### General Considerations
- **Random Sampling**: Regularly apply random sampling techniques for splitting the dataset to avoid bias.
- **Stratification**: For classification problems, ensure that the splits are stratified to maintain the proportional distribution of classes across datasets.
- **Consistency in Preprocessing**: The same preprocessing steps applied to the training data must also be applied to the validation and test sets to ensure consistency.
- **Reproducibility**: Document the dataset splitting process to allow for reproducibility and validation of results.

By adhering to these requirements, the effectiveness and reliability of model training, tuning, and evaluation can be significantly improved.",8,8,9,8.200000000000001,0,0,0,0.0

What is automation bias?,The tendency to automatically rely or over-rely on the output produced by a high-risk AI system.,"Automation bias is a tendency to over-rely on the output of an automated system, even when there is reason to believe that the system may be inaccurate or incomplete. This can lead to errors in decision-making, as the human operator may not be fully aware of the limitations of the system and may not be able to adequately compensate for them. (Source: ""Top 10 operational impacts of the EU AI Act"" by IAPP)

In the context of high-risk AI systems, automation bias can be a particular concern, as these systems are often used to provide information or recommendations for decisions to be taken by natural persons. (Source: ""EU AI Act"" by the European Commission)

To mitigate the risk of automation bias, providers of high-risk AI systems must design and develop their systems so that they can be effectively overseen by an individual. (Source: ""Top 10 operational impacts of the EU AI Act"" by IAPP) This includes providing users with clear instructions on how to use the system and ensuring that users are aware of the system's limitations. (Source: ""OT-comformity-assessments-ebook.pdf"" by TÜV SÜD)

Users of high-risk AI systems should also be aware of the potential for automation bias and take steps to mitigate this risk. This includes being critical of the system's output and considering alternative sources of information before making decisions. (Source: ""Top 10 operational impacts of the EU AI Act"" by IAPP)","Automation bias is a cognitive phenomenon where individuals place excessive trust in automated systems or technology, often leading to the over-reliance on these tools for decision-making. This bias can result in diminished critical thinking, where users may ignore their own knowledge or experiences because they assume that the automated system is more accurate or capable.

In practical scenarios, automation bias can manifest in various fields, including healthcare (e.g., trusting a diagnosis suggested by an AI system over a clinician's judgment), aviation (e.g., pilots relying too heavily on autopilot systems), and finance (e.g., traders following algorithmic recommendations without questioning them). 

While automation can enhance efficiency and accuracy, the risk is that users may become complacent, overlooking potential errors or limitations of the technology. Addressing automation bias involves promoting awareness of its existence, encouraging active engagement with automated systems, and fostering a balanced approach where human judgment and technology complement each other.",8,7,8,7.6,9,8,9,8.600000000000001
What is required for each use of a real-time remote biometric identification system in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement purposes?,Express and specific authorization by a judicial authority or an independent administrative authority of a Member State.,"For each use of a real-time remote biometric identification system in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement purposes, the following is required:

* **Prior authorization:** Each individual use must be subject to prior authorization granted by a judicial authority or an independent administrative authority of the Member State in which the use is to take place. The authorization must be issued upon a reasoned request and in accordance with the detailed rules of national law. (Source: eu_ai_act.pdf, paragraph 3)

* **Urgency exception:** In a duly justified situation of urgency, the use of the system may be commenced without an authorization. However, the authorization must be requested during or after the use. (Source: eu_ai_act.pdf, paragraph 3)

* **Objective evidence or clear indications:** The competent judicial or administrative authority shall only grant the authorization where it is satisfied, based on objective evidence or clear indications presented to it, that the use of the ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification system at issue is necessary for and proportionate to achieving one of the objectives specified in paragraph 1(d). (Source: eu_ai_act.pdf, paragraph 3)

* **Objectives:** The objectives for which the system may be used are: (Source: eu_ai_act.pdf, paragraph 1(d))
    * The targeted search for specific potential victims of crime, including missing children
    * The prevention of a specific, substantial and imminent threat to the life or physical safety of natural persons or of a terrorist attack
    * The detection, localization, identification or prosecution of a perpetrator or suspect of a criminal offense referred to in Article 2(2) of Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA and punishable in the Member State concerned by a custodial sentence or a detention order for a maximum period of at least three years, as determined by the law of that Member State","The use of real-time remote biometric identification systems (RBI) in publicly accessible spaces by law enforcement often involves a complex set of regulations and requirements, which can vary by jurisdiction. However, some common requirements might include:

1. **Legal Authority**: Law enforcement agencies typically need clear legal authority to deploy such systems, which may include specific legislation or policies that govern the use of biometric identification.

2. **Purpose Limitation**: The use of the RBI system should be limited to specific purposes, such as crime prevention, investigation, and public safety. Agencies must have an official justification for using the technology.

3. **Transparency and Accountability**:
   - **Public Disclosure**: Authorities may be required to inform the public about the use of such technologies, including the purpose, scope, and duration of the surveillance.
   - **Policy Development**: Agencies should have a clearly defined policy outlining the use, governance, and oversight of the system.

4. **Data Protection and Privacy**:
   - **Data Minimization**: Collect only the biometric data necessary for the intended purpose.
   - **Encryption and Security**: Implement robust security measures to protect collected biometric data from unauthorized access and breaches.
   - **Retention and Deletion**: Define clear policies regarding how long biometric data will be retained and establish procedures for proper deletion when no longer needed.

5. **Impact Assessments**: Conduct assessments (like Data Protection Impact Assessments - DPIAs) before deploying the system to evaluate potential risks to privacy and civil liberties.

6. **Oversight and Review Mechanisms**: Establish oversight bodies or processes to regularly review the use and effectiveness of the technology, including measures for accountability.

7. **Training and Governance**: Ensure that law enforcement personnel are trained in the appropriate and ethical use of biometric systems, and set guidelines for how this technology is managed.

8. **Public Consultation**: In some jurisdictions, engaging with the community or stakeholders may be necessary to gather input and address concerns related to the use of biometric surveillance.

9. **Compliance with Existing Laws**: Ensure compliance with other relevant laws and regulations, such as those related to privacy, civil rights, and data protection.

10. **Limitations on Use**: Specify any limitations or restrictions on the use of the technology, such as prohibitions on discrimination or misuse of the data.
