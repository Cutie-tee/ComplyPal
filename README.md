Installation

Basic Setup
-I began by cloning the repository and setting up the project environment-
-Next, I created and activated a virtual environment:
-After activating the environment, I installed all the necessary dependencies:
-Environment Configuration
-I set up the environment configuration by first creating the environment file:
-Then I configured the API keys and other settings in the .env file:

# Vector DB Configuration
CHUNK_SIZE=1000
CHUNK_OVERLAP=200


# Model Configuration
TEMPERATURE=0.5
model - gemini-pro

# File Paths
PDF_DIR=./pdf_docs
CHROMA_DB_PATH=./chroma_db
LOG_DIR=./logs
Document Setup
For document management, I created the necessary directories for PDF documents and logs:
-Set up the questionnaire configuration with the following structure: csvCopyquestion,type,options,help_text,placeholder

# Vector DB Configuration
CHUNK_SIZE=1000
CHUNK_OVERLAP=200
RETRIEVAL_K=4

# Model Configuration
TEMPERATURE=0.7
TOP_P=0.8
TOP_K=40
MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS=2048

# File Paths
PDF_DIR=./pdf_docs
CHROMA_DB_PATH=./chroma_db
LOG_DIR=./logs
```

### Document Setup

1. Prepare your compliance documents:
```bash
mkdir -p pdf_docs logs
```

2. Place your PDF documents in the `pdf_docs` directory:
- Regulatory documents
- Compliance guidelines
- Standard operating procedures
- Best practice documents

3. Configure the questionnaire:
```bash
# Example questionnaire.csv structure
question,type,options,help_text,placeholder
"Describe your data processing activities",textarea,,Provide details about how you handle customer data,Enter your data processing details...
"Do you collect sensitive data?",radio,"[""Yes"",""No"",""Not Sure""]",Select if you handle sensitive personal information,
"Which security measures do you have?",multiselect,"[""Encryption"",""Access Control"",""Regular Audits"",""DPO Appointed""]",Select all security measures in place,
```

 Important Notes
- All API keys are kept secret
- PDF documents need to be included in the repository
- Vector DB is rebuilt on each deployment
