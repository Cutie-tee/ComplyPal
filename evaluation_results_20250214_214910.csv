What approach is used to determine the regulatory burden placed on AI systems?,A risk-based approach is used.,"The AI Act uses a risk-based approach to determine the regulatory burden placed on AI systems. This means that the level of regulation will vary depending on the perceived risk associated with the system.

The AI Act classifies AI systems into three risk categories:

* **Unacceptable risk:** AI systems that pose an unacceptable risk to safety, health, or fundamental rights are prohibited from being placed on the market.
* **High risk:** AI systems that pose a high risk to safety, health, or fundamental rights must comply with a number of strict requirements, including transparency, accountability, and human oversight.
* **Low risk:** AI systems that pose a low risk to safety, health, or fundamental rights are subject to fewer requirements.

The AI Act also establishes a subset of general-purpose AI with systemic risk, which refers to a general-purpose AI model that ""has high impact capabilities evaluated on the basis of the cumulative amount of computation used for its training measured in floating point operations."" Providers of GPAI models that involve systemic risk are subject to a specific set of regulatory obligations under the AI Act.

The risk-based approach is intended to ensure that the regulatory burden is proportionate to the risk posed by the AI system. This approach is consistent with the principle of proportionality, which is a fundamental principle of EU law.

- **Representativeness**: Should be representative of the real-world data the model will encounter. This includes having a balanced representation of different classes if it is a classification problem.
- **Quality**: Should be free from systemic biases and errors. Proper preprocessing (cleaning, normalization, encoding) should be applied to ensure high-quality data.
- **Features**: Must include all relevant features that contribute to the prediction outcome.

### 2. Validation Dataset
- **Purpose**: Used to tune hyperparameters and make decisions about model configurations (like architecture, learning rate, etc.), as well as to prevent overfitting.
- **Size**: Needs to be sufficiently large to provide reliable metrics for model evaluation during training. A common split of the total dataset may allocate around 10-20% for validation.
- **Independence**: Should be independent of the training dataset to ensure unbiased performance estimates. It should not be used during the training process.
- **Quality**: Like the training data, it should be clean and representative of the overall dataset.

### 3. Testing Dataset
- **Purpose**: Used to evaluate the final model's performance and generalization ability after the model has been trained and validated.
- **Size**: Similar to the validation set, it needs to be large enough to provide a reliable estimate of model performance but is often around 10-30% of the total dataset.
- **Independence**: Must be completely independent of both the training and validation datasets. The test set should not be used at any point during the model development process.
- **Quality**: Should also be free from biases or anomalies that could skew results. It must accurately reflect the distribution and characteristics of the data that the model will see in real-world applications.

### General Considerations
- **Splitting**: When splitting the dataset into these three subsets, stratified sampling may be used especially in classification tasks to preserve the classes' distribution in all subsets.
- **Cross-Validation**: In cases where data is limited, techniques like k-fold cross-validation can be utilized to make the most out of available data by rotating the training and validation sets over multiple iterations.
- **Data Augmentation**: For small datasets, techniques like data augmentation can also be used to artificially increase the size of the training set.
- **Performance Metrics**: Choose appropriate metrics based on the model's objective (e.g., accuracy, F1 score, AUC-ROC) for validation and testing to ensure that evaluation aligns with business or application goals.

By adhering to these requirements, the resulting model will be more likely to generalize well to unseen data in practical applications.",8,8,8,8.0,7,8,9,7.8
