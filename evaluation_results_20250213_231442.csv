"What are the requirements for training, validation, and testing data sets?","They shall be relevant, representative, free of errors and complete. They shall have the appropriate statistical properties, including, where applicable, as regards the persons or groups of persons on which the high-risk AI system is intended to be used.","Training, validation, and testing data sets shall be relevant, representative, free of errors and complete. They shall have the appropriate statistical properties, including, where applicable, as regards the persons or groups of persons on which the high-risk AI system is intended to be used. These characteristics of the data sets may be met at the level of individual data sets or a combination thereof.","Training, validation, and testing datasets are crucial components of machine learning model development. Each serves a different purpose, and specific requirements help ensure effective model training and evaluation. Here's an overview of the requirements for each dataset:

### Training Set:
1. **Size**: Should be large enough to capture the underlying patterns of the data. The amount needed can depend on the complexity of the model and the diversity of the data.
2. **Representativeness**: Should represent the overall population from which the data is drawn. It must include all relevant features and variations.
3. **Quality**: Data should be clean and well-prepared, with minimal errors or inconsistencies.
4. **Feature Diversity**: Should include diverse examples to help the model learn to generalize from various scenarios.
5. **Balanced Representation**: For classification tasks, it is essential to have a balanced dataset in terms of classes to prevent biased predictions towards any particular class.

### Validation Set:
1. **Size**: Should be large enough to provide a reliable estimate of the model's performance, but typically smaller than the training set.
2. **Independence**: Must be independent of the training data to give an unbiased assessment of the model's performance during hyperparameter tuning.
3. **Quality**: Like the training set, the validation set must be clean and representative of the data distribution.
4. **Same Distribution**: Should maintain the same data distribution as the training set to ensure that validation metrics are valid for assessing the model.
5. **Used for Hyperparameter Tuning**: It is used to evaluate different model configurations and select the best set of hyperparameters.

### Testing Set:
1. **Size**: Should be large enough to ensure reliable performance metrics (typically larger than the validation set).
2. **Independence**: Must be completely independent of both the training and validation datasets to accurately evaluate the model's generalization capabilities.
3. **Quality**: Should also be clean and well-prepared, resembling the training and validation data in terms of features and distributions.
4. **Final Evaluation**: Used for the final evaluation after the model has been trained and tuned, providing a measure of how well the model is expected to perform in real-world scenarios.

### General Considerations:
- **Data Splitting**: There's no one-size-fits-all approach to splitting data among these datasets, but a common practice is to allocate around 60%-80% for training, 10%-20% for validation, and 10%-20% for testing, depending on the total data size.
- **Shuffling**: Before splitting, it’s often recommended to shuffle the dataset to avoid any biases that may arise from the order of the data.
- **Cross-Validation**: For smaller datasets, techniques like k-fold cross-validation can be used to ensure more robust model evaluation.

By adhering to these requirements, you can help ensure that your machine learning models are not only effective during training but also generalize well to unseen data.",5,3
