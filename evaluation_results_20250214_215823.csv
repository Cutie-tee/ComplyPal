[Sources: eu_ai_act.pdf, Article 3(3)]","When working with machine learning models, the requirements for training, validation, and testing datasets can vary depending on the specific application and the methodology used. However, there are general guidelines and best practices that are widely applicable across different scenarios. Here are the key requirements for each type of dataset:

### 1. Training Dataset
- **Size**: The training dataset should be large enough to capture the underlying patterns and relationships within the data. A larger dataset often leads to a more robust model.
- **Representativeness**: It should accurately represent the problem space and include examples of all classes or groups that the model will encounter.
- **Quality**: Data should be clean, relevant, and free of significant errors. Noise and outliers should be minimized to avoid misleading the model.
- **Balanced**: In classification tasks, the classes should ideally be balanced to prevent bias towards more frequent classes (unless using techniques to handle class imbalance).
- **Feature Diversity**: The dataset should include a variety of features that are relevant to the task to ensure that the model can learn effectively.

### 2. Validation Dataset
- **Size**: The validation set can be smaller than the training set but should still be large enough to provide reliable estimates of model performance.
- **Independent**: It should be separate from the training data to provide an unbiased estimate of the model's performance during training.
- **Representativeness**: It should also be representative of the domain, ideally including scenarios the model will face when deployed.
- **Timeliness**: The validation data should reflect the same distribution of data as would be expected in production, particularly in time-sensitive applications.

### 3. Testing Dataset
- **Size**: Similar to the validation set, the testing dataset should be large enough to allow for statistical significance when evaluating performance.
- **Complete Independence**: The test dataset must be completely independent of both the training and validation datasets to provide an objective evaluation of the model's performance.
- **Representativeness**: Like the other datasets, it should represent the problem domain, capturing the variability of data one would expect in real use cases.
- **No Overlap**: Ensure that there is no overlap between the training, validation, and testing datasets to avoid data leakage.

### Additional Considerations
- **Randomization**: When splitting datasets, it's essential to randomize the selection process to avoid any bias in the ordering or selection that could influence model performance.
- **Stratification**: For classification problems, stratified sampling is often used to ensure that the proportions of different classes are preserved in all datasets.
- **Preprocessing Consistency**: Any data preprocessing, normalization, or feature extraction steps applied to the training data should also be applied to the validation and test datasets in the same way.
- **Documentation**: Keep thorough documentation on how datasets are gathered, cleaned, and split. This transparency is crucial for reproducibility and compliance with regulations, particularly in sensitive fields.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your training, validation, and testing datasets are set up effectively, which is critical for developing high-performing and reliable machine learning models.",8,8,7,7.800000000000001,5,6,7,5.800000000000001
