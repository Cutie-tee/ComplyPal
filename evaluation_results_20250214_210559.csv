* **Consent given in a non-verbal manner:** Consent must be expressed clearly and unambiguously, either verbally or in writing.
* **Consent that is withdrawn:** Individuals have the right to withdraw consent at any time.","Valid consent is a crucial component in various contexts, especially in legal, medical, and interpersonal situations, and it must meet certain criteria to be considered valid. Here are several actions and conditions that do not constitute valid consent:

1. **Coercion or Duress**: If consent is obtained through force, threats, or intimidation, it is not valid. Individuals must have the freedom to choose without fear of negative consequences.

2. **Manipulation or Deception**: Consent obtained through deceit, such as lying about the nature of an act or the consequences, is not valid. Individuals must have a clear understanding of what they are consenting to.

3. **Incapacity**: If an individual lacks the mental capacity to understand what they are consenting to, such as due to intoxication, mental illness, or developmental disabilities, their consent is not valid. This includes situations where someone is under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

4. **Underage Consent**: In many jurisdictions, individuals below a certain age (often 18) cannot provide valid legal consent, particularly in sexual contexts. Laws regarding age of consent vary by location, but generally, minors are not considered capable of giving informed consent.

5. **Past Behavior as Consent**: Consent is not a one-time agreement; previous consent does not imply ongoing consent. Each situation requires separate and explicit consent.

6. **Informed Consent**: In the context of medical procedures, valid consent must be informed. This means that the individual must be provided with adequate information about the procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives. Consent that is not fully informed is invalid.

7. **Silent or Passive Responses**: Simply not saying ""no"" or being passive does not constitute valid consent. Consent must be explicit and affirmative, with clear and enthusiastic agreement.

8. **Withdrawal of Consent**: Consent can be revoked at any time. Once consent is withdrawn, any further actions without new consent are not valid. It's essential to respect the decision of the individual who withdraws consent.

9. **Unconsciousness or Sleep**: Individuals who are unconscious, asleep, or otherwise incapacitated cannot provide valid consent. This includes both physical and mental incapacitation.

10. **Misunderstanding or Miscommunication**: If either party misunderstands the nature of the consent or the terms involved, then such consent may be invalid. Clarity in communication is essential for valid consent.

In summary, valid consent requires clear, informed, and voluntary agreement, and it must be given by an individual who has the capacity to consent. Always ensure that consent is ongoing, explicit, and can be retracted at any time.",4,2

3. **Confirmation Bias:** People may exhibit a tendency to seek out or favor information that confirms their existing beliefs or assumptions. When using automated systems, individuals may selectively accept outputs that align with these biases, even if the results might not accurately reflect the situation or context.

4. **Overconfidence:** Users may develop an overconfidence in the system’s abilities, which can lead to neglecting critical thinking or failing to verify the results. This overconfidence can be particularly problematic in high-stakes environments, such as aviation, healthcare, or finance, where errors can have severe consequences.

5. **Desensitization to Errors:** Repeated exposure to automated systems can desensitize individuals to the potential for error. As people become accustomed to the outputs of these systems, they may become less alert to discrepancies or mistakes that would have previously warranted further examination.

The implications of automation bias can be significant, especially in fields that rely heavily on automated systems. Concerns arise in areas such as:

- **Healthcare:** Clinicians might overly trust diagnostic algorithms or predictive models, potentially overlooking important patient-specific factors or alternative diagnoses.
- **Aviation:** Pilots could rely on autopilot systems or flight management software, leading to a lack of readiness to take manual control in emergency situations.
- **Finance:** Investors might depend on algorithmic trading systems without adequately assessing the underlying data or market conditions.

To mitigate automation bias, organizations can implement strategies such as training and awareness programs that emphasize the importance of critical thinking and human judgment alongside automated recommendations. Encouraging a culture of collaboration between human decision-makers and automated systems can help ensure that both perspectives are considered before arriving at a final decision. Additionally, regularly reviewing and updating the automated systems can help maintain their reliability and accuracy, thereby fostering a healthier balance between automation and human expertise.",8,9
What is required for each use of a real-time remote biometric identification system in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement purposes?,Express and specific authorization by a judicial authority or an independent administrative authority of a Member State.,"**Requirements for Each Use of a Real-Time Remote Biometric Identification System in Publicly Accessible Spaces for Law Enforcement Purposes**

According to the ""NIST Special Publication 800-187: Considerations for the Use of Real-Time Remote Biometric Identification Systems in Publicly Accessible Spaces for Law Enforcement Purposes"" (NIST SP 800-187), the following requirements must be met for each use of a real-time remote biometric identification system in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement purposes:

**1. Reasonable Suspicion:**

* Law enforcement officers must have a reasonable suspicion that the individual being scanned has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime.

**2. Identification Purpose:**

* The scan must be used solely for the purpose of identifying the individual, not for other purposes such as tracking or surveillance.

**3. Informed Consent:**

* Individuals must be informed of the purpose of the scan, the potential consequences of a match, and their right to refuse the scan.

**4. Transparency and Accountability:**

* There must be clear policies and procedures governing the use of the system, including:
    * Who can use the system
    * When and where the system can be used
    * How the data will be used and stored
    * Who will have access to the data

**5. Data Security:**

* The system must have robust security measures in place to protect the privacy and security of the biometric data, including:
    * Encryption
    * Access control
    * Data retention policies

**6. Accuracy and Reliability:**

* The system must be accurate and reliable in identifying individuals, and the limitations of the system must be clearly communicated to users.

**7. Bias Mitigation:**

* The system must be designed and tested to minimize bias and ensure that it does not discriminate against any particular population group.

**8. Oversight and Accountability:**

* There must be independent oversight of the system to ensure compliance with these requirements and to address any concerns or complaints.

**9. Public Notification:**

* The public must be notified of the presence and use of the system in publicly accessible spaces.

**10. Evaluation and Review:**

* The system must be regularly evaluated and reviewed to ensure that it is meeting the requirements and is not being used in a discriminatory or abusive manner.","The use of real-time remote biometric identification systems (RBIS) in publicly accessible spaces by law enforcement raises a host of legal, ethical, and technical considerations. Here are some key requirements that are generally needed for each use of such systems:

### 1. **Legal Framework and Compliance**
   - **Legislation**: There must be clear legal provisions permitting the use of biometric identification systems. This includes compliance with local laws, national regulations, and international standards on privacy and data protection.
   - **Policy Guidelines**: Law enforcement agencies should have specific policies governing the deployment and use of RBIS, outlining acceptable scenarios for its use, oversight mechanisms, and accountability measures.

### 2. **Purpose Limitation**
   - **Specific Use Cases**: The use of RBIS must be restricted to defined purposes, such as crime prevention, public safety, or as part of investigations. General surveillance should typically be avoided to protect civil liberties.

### 3. **Privacy and Data Protection**
   - **Data Minimization**: Only the necessary biometric data should be collected and processed. Excessive data collection should be avoided.
   - **Retention Policies**: There must be a clear policy regarding how long biometric data will be retained, with guidelines on secure deletion after the retention period is over.
   - **Transparency**: Clear communication about the use of RBIS should be provided to the public, including information about data collection, processing, and their rights related to their biometric data.

### 4. **Consent and Public Awareness**
   - **Informed Consent**: Although in public spaces this can often be a gray area, efforts should be made to inform the public about surveillance activities and seek consent where feasible.
   - **Public Engagement**: Engaging with community stakeholders to discuss and obtain feedback on the implementation of RBIS can improve public trust and accountability.

### 5. **Technical Standards and Accuracy**
   - **Technical Reliability**: The biometric identification system must meet established technical benchmarks for accuracy, including false positive and false negative rates, to minimize wrongful identifications.
   - **Interoperability**: The system should be compatible with existing law enforcement databases and technologies, allowing for seamless integration and use.

### 6. **Oversight and Accountability**
   - **Monitoring and Evaluation**: Continuous oversight mechanisms should be in place to monitor the use of RBIS. Regular audits and impact assessments can ensure accountability.
   - **Reporting Requirements**: Law enforcement agencies should be required to report on the usage of RBIS, including the number of identifications, false positives, and outcomes of usage.

### 7. **Training and Staff Guidelines**
   - **Training for Personnel**: Law enforcement personnel using the system must undergo appropriate training on the technology, protocols for its use, and ethical considerations.
   - **Use of Protocols**: Standard operating procedures should be established to guide officers in the appropriate use of RBIS, including responses to identification and privacy concerns.

### 8. **Security Measures**
   - **Data Security**: Adequate measures must be in place to protect the data collected from unauthorized access, breaches, and misuse.
   - **Incident Response Plans**: Plans should be established for responding to data breaches or other security incidents involving the biometric data.
