"What are the requirements for training, validation, and testing data sets?","They shall be relevant, representative, free of errors and complete. They shall have the appropriate statistical properties, including, where applicable, as regards the persons or groups of persons on which the high-risk AI system is intended to be used.","Training, validation, and testing data sets shall be relevant, representative, free of errors and complete. They shall have the appropriate statistical properties, including, where applicable, as regards the persons or groups of persons on which the high-risk AI system is intended to be used. These characteristics of the data sets may be met at the level of individual data sets or a combination thereof.","When preparing data sets for training, validation, and testing in machine learning, there are several important requirements and best practices to consider:

### 1. **Data Quality**
   - **Cleanliness**: Data should be free of errors, missing values, and outliers if possible. Preprocessing steps like handling missing values, outlier detection, and noise reduction are essential.
   - **Relevance**: The data should be relevant to the problem you are trying to solve.

### 2. **Size of Data Sets**
   - **Training Set**: Should be large enough to allow the model to learn effectively. Typically, this is the largest portion of the total data (often around 70-80%).
   - **Validation Set**: Smaller than the training set, usually around 10-15% of the total data. It is used to fine-tune model parameters and avoid overfitting.
   - **Testing Set**: This set should also be around 10-15% of the total data and is used for the final evaluation of the model after training and validation.

### 3. **Data Distribution**
   - The data should represent the true distribution of the problem domain to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data. This includes ensuring that the training, validation, and test sets are drawn from the same distribution.

### 4. **Stratification**
   - If the target variable is imbalanced (e.g., in classification tasks), it's important to stratify the data when creating training, validation, and testing sets. This ensures that each subset maintains the original distribution of the target classes.

### 5. **Randomization**
   - Splitting the data randomly is important to avoid biases. However, if time series data is involved, ensure that data splitting respects the temporal order of the data to prevent data leakage.

### 6. **Independent and Identically Distributed (i.i.d.) Assumption**
   - The samples in each set should be independent and identically distributed to ensure effective learning and evaluation.

### 7. **No Data Leakage**
   - Ensure that information from the validation or test set does not influence the training process. This includes avoiding feature engineering based on the entire dataset or using any data from the test set during model training.

### 8. **Homogeneity of Features**
   - The features used in each set should be consistent, meaning the same preprocessing steps should be applied across training, validation, and testing sets. 

### 9. **Balanced Representation**
   - For tasks where certain classes may be underrepresented, it may be necessary to ensure that this representation is balanced across the training, validation, and test sets.

Overall, careful consideration of these requirements helps build robust models that generalize well to new, unseen data.",5,4
